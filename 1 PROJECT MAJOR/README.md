## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main web interface
- `POST /start_scan` - Start 15-second emotion scan
- `POST /stop_scan` - Stop the current scan
- `GET /get_scan_data` - Get current scan results and statistics
- `POST /reset_data` - Reset all data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'"
**Solution:** Install required packages:
```bash
python -m pip install keras tensorflow opencv-python numpy flask
```

### Issue: "Camera not found" or "Cannot access camera"
**Solution:** 
- Check if your camera is connected and functioning
- Close other applications using the camera
- Check camera permissions in Windows settings

### Issue: "Port 5000 is already in use"
**Solution:** Either:
- Close other applications using port 5000
- Modify the port in `app.py` line: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`

### Issue: Emotion detection accuracy is low
**Solution:**
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep your face clearly visible to the camera
- Avoid partial faces or obscured features
- Make clear emotional expressions

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Lighting** - Use bright, natural light or a well-lit room
2. **Distance** - Keep your face about 30-60 cm from the camera
3. **Expressions** - Make clear, distinct emotional expressions
4. **Duration** - The 15-second scan period gives better accuracy with multiple samples
5. **Multiples Scans** - Try multiple scans for more accurate results

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Limitations

- Requires webcam access
- Works best with frontal face views
- May have lower accuracy with:
  - Glasses or sunglasses
  - Face masks
  - Heavy makeup variations
  - Poor lighting conditions
  - Profile views

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add facial expression intensity tracking
- [ ] Save scan history and statistics
- [ ] Export reports as PDF
- [ ] Real-time video stream to browser
- [ ] Support for multiple faces
- [ ] Custom music playlist integration
- [ ] Dark mode UI toggle
